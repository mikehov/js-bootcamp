# Plagiarism

💁  We don’t like plagiarism and report it to our assessment committee
([examencommissie](https://moodle.cmd.hva.nl/mod/page/view.php?id=1738) in Dutch). See ¶ 6.1.2 of Teaching and Examination
Regulations (TER) 2017-2018 (in Dutch: Onderwijs- en examenregeling, OER) for
a full definition, but here are a few cases that count as plagiarism:

> a. using or copying someone else’s texts, data or ideas without a full and
> correct acknowledgement of sources;
> b. presenting the structure or central ideas developed by someone else as
> your own work or ideas, even when a reference to other authors has been
> included;
>
> \[…]
>
> e. copying (parts of) media files or other sources, software source codes,
> models and other diagrams of other people without acknowledgement and
> allowing it to be held as your own work;
>
> \[…]
>
> g. copying the work of fellow-students and allowing it to be held as your
> own work;
>
> \[…]

You are not allowed to simply use portions of someone else's work in your project. The copyright is owned by the creator of the work. You must cite the sources used. Quoting or using material without a source citation is plagiarism and is punishable. More information on the [Student Copyright Information Point](https://www.amsterdamuas.com/library/services/copyright/students.html)

The manner in which you cite your sources depends. The most widely used style at the AUAS is [APA](https://www.amsterdamuas.com/library/services/acknowledging-sources/apa-style/apa-style.html) of the American Psychological Association. Make sure you cite your sources in the repository, code comments or documentation of your project on GitHub.

## Open source software

We strongly urge you to use free and open source software in the form of libraries and require you to use Node. If you find a project on GitHub (or similar platforms), that doesn’t mean that you are allowed to use it. Projects must have a license that explicitly lets you use it. Acknowledge the authors of these works by citing their name and linking to their projects.

## Help

In this course, we require you to collaborate with team members. We also strongly urge you to help your class mates. Please refrain from doing their work for them. You can often tell when you cross that line. Don’t cross it. And always acknowledge when someone helped you.
