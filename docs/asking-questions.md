# Asking Questions

If you have technical questions feel free to ask them in our Slack but keep the following in mind:

* Don't use screenshots but link to specific files or snippets in your repo.
* Accurately describe your problem and let teachers know which solutions you've already tried.
* Ask questions in the #slackoverflow channel instead of direct messaging teachers. Other students might have encountered the same problem and found a solution.

## Tech Shaming
If you're answering a question of your fellow student, **never ever tech shame**. Never write a snobby put down of someones technical ability or inferior knowledge for not using or knowing about a piece of technology. **Teachers will enforce our Code of Conduct on our Slack.**
