# Open Source Course

Our curriculum and course material is publicly available on the Block Tech (cmda-bt) GitHub organization. We follow the global trend to make teaching materials accessible to everyone inspired by the [OpenCourseware Consortium][oec].

You can view content, such as readers, notes and book lists but also look at student examples after the course is finished. Feel free to browser around! If you are not a student at the AUAS or aren't enrolled in this specific course on Brightspace, it is not possible to ask questions to teachers.

We keep students personal information, grade lists, assessment results and communication [private](/docs/privacy.md).
